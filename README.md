# Not
WIP

This component library is possible to acquire asynchronous data before rendering. this is like next.js :policeman:

I have made [`async-react-router`](https://github.com/oneut/async-react-router) like Routing of Next.js in the past.
But, that library is very complicated.
In order to make it more simple, I made `next-props` as a component library, not routing library.

# Feature
+ This is component library of React.
+ Support React version 16.
+ Support async/await like next.js.
+ No depend on react-router.
+ No depend on rxjs.
    + But, You can combine asynchronous library like rxjs.
